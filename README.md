# Welcome!
## Just an internet indexer.

I just made an Internet indexer, which, without unnecessary garbage, helps you find various Internet sites in automatic mode.
For it to work, you just need to specify the port, protocol and number of sites! It will find a variety of sites for you and sort them by file, live - in a separate file, dead - in a separate one.

###### How much does the program cost?
This program is free, if you find an error, then just report it and offer your own solution if you are a developer.

Attention! Web scanning is illegal in some countries and can lead to criminal liability! The author is not responsible for how you use this program!
